# Movie Recommendation Website

This is a **movie recommendation website** built using **Streamlit**. The project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to recommend movies based on user input. The recommendations are generated by calculating the similarity between movies using **cosine similarity**. The closer the cosine similarity values, the more relevant the recommendations.

---

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Powered by Streamlit for a smooth and interactive experience.
- **NLP-based Recommendations**: Utilizes advanced text processing techniques to compare movie overviews.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between movies to recommend the most relevant ones.
- **TMDB 5000 Dataset**: Recommendations are based on the comprehensive TMDB 5000 movies dataset.

---

## How It Works

1. **Dataset**: The TMDB 5000 dataset is used, which includes information about movies such as title, overview, genres, and more.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: The movie overviews are processed using NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, vectorization).
3. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Cosine similarity is computed between the input movie and all other movies in the dataset.
   - Movies with the highest similarity scores are recommended.
4. **Interactive Search**:
   - Users can type the name of a movie.
   - The system will display a list of similar movies.
